# Welcome

## Iâ€™m currently working on the FAIR Phytolith Project
### I am working on improving the phytolith research community workflow.
### I am using a participant-observation approach to learn about the raw materials, techniques, technology, and purposes of basket making.
### I aim to learn how practitioners assess the properties or qualities of the materials they use, and how the materials are related to end products and uses.
## My personal research concerns the study of plant physical properties and the identification of plant-based technology found in archaeological contexts.
